# LifecycleModeling
To model your suited lifecycle, depending on your character and context.

## Final goal
To make humanity happy  

## Second goal
*Ways to achieve the final goal*

To help people live the best life  

## Third goal
*Ways to achieve the second goal*

To let people:

1. Have a hard goal of life  
2. Make efforts to achieve the goal  
3. Grow to achieve the goal  

## What to do
*Ways to achieve the third goal*

To suggest:

1. Goals which depend on user's character and context  
2. Activities which are needed to achieve the goal  

## How to do
1. Discover the relationship among human's character, context, daily activities, and lifestyle
2. Record user's character, context, daily activities
3. Suggest suited goal of life to users who still don't find their goal
4. Suggest suited activities to users who have already found their goal

## Why do
Only few people take the best way in their life. Many people die without understanding their unique characteristics, and without showing maximum performance because of their context. I think that's a huge loss for humanity. No one loves loss without benefit. That's why I want to complete this project.
